## How to contribute to Edacious

#### **Reporting bugs**

You can use [Bugzilla](https://bugs.csoft.net/enter_bug.cgi?product=Edacious)
to report bugs. You can also open up a GitHub issue, contact the
[maintainer](mailto:vedge@hypertriton.com), or ask for help on the
[Agar Mailing List](https://mail231.csoft.net/lists/listinfo/agar)
or the #libagar IRC channel on freenode.

#### **Submitting patches**

Casual contributors can submit patches using the
[Bugzilla](https://bugs.csoft.net/enter_bug.cgi?product=Edacious)
or by sending an e-mail to maintainer or the mailing list.

More frequent contributors can request a developer account with write access
to the [Main Repository](https://dev.csoft.net). Note: Using GitHub pull
requests is not preferable because active development takes place on the main
subversion repository.

#### **Try Csoft.net Hosting**

The [Csoft.net Hosting](https://csoft.net) Company, which first advertised on
Slashdot back in 1998, has been providing the the funding and resources
necessary in developing Edacious since the beginning. Now located in New York,
Csoft.net provides physically secure, non-virtualized gigabit Unix hosting
with SSH access for as low as $5.

#### **Buy from ElectronTubeStore**

Our sponsor [ElectronTubeStore](https://electrontubestore.com) provides raw
materials, useful parts and components. ElectronTubeStore ships worldwide,
quickly and economically. If you are looking for a reputable supplier for a
specific chip, transistor, vacuum tube, connector, hard to find material, or
any metal alloy in any shape, check out ElectronTubeStore.com.
