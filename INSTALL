Prerequisites
-------------
Agar-EDA requires the Agar and FreeSG libraries. You can compile them from
source or download one of the many precompiled packages at:

	http://libagar.org/download.html
	http://freesg.org/download.html

Installation under Unix
-----------------------
1) Execute the configure script. See `./configure --help' for options.
    $ ./configure

2) Compile the libraries and executables.
    $ make depend all
    # make install

3) Let the developers know of your success/failure. If you happen to run
   into trouble, please set a valid return address so we can respond.
    $ cat config.log | mail -s "compiles fine" compile@hypertriton.com

Installation under SGI IRIX
---------------------------
Under IRIX, we recommend using gcc3 (or SGI cc) because of gcc 2.95 issues
with varargs. There are .tardist packages for gcc3, SDL and freetype
available from: http://www.nekochan.net/.

Installation under Windows
--------------------------
Under Windows, Agar-EDA can be compiled under Microsoft Visual Studio,
Cygwin and MSYS. Precompiled packages may be available from the Agar-EDA
download page.

Concurrent building
-------------------
Under Unix, it is possible to build Agar-EDA outside of the source directory.
Developers will generally prefer this method, since it results in a faster
build, does not clutter the source directories with object files and
facilitates testing on multiple machines using network filesystems.

1) Create the build directory. Where available, a memory filesystem is a
   good location to build from.
    $ mkdir w-agareda
    $ cd w-agareda

2) Run configure from the source directory with --srcdir.
    $ ~/agar-eda-sources/configure --srcdir=$HOME/agar-eda-sources [...]

3) Now build the libraries and executables as you normally would.
    $ make depend && make
    # make install
